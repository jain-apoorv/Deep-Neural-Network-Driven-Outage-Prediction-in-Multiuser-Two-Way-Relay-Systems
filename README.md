# Deep-Neural-Network-Driven-Outage-Prediction-in-Multiuser-Two-Way-Relay-Systems

DNN-based outage evaluation for a cellular multiuser two-way relay (TWR) system with beamforming and mobile station (MS) selection to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This repo leverages deep neural networks to predict system outages in real-time, reducing offline execution time and computational complexity.
